Particle Swarm Optimization scheme for GOSIA/GOSIA2 minimization

This code runs a particle swarm optimization scheme on GOSIA to try to find the best 
minimum. PSO is very computationally expensive, but if sufficient computational power is available, this algorithm is very effective at finding the global minima in GOSIA optimizations. For instructions on using this code, please see Appendix B of the Ph.D. thesis of Ava Hill. A copy of this appendix is included in this repository.
